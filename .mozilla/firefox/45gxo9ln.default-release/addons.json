Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.\n\nFAQ: Does OneTab work on the Android version of Firefox?\nA: The latest version Includes experimental support for the upcoming Firefox Android release. Please note that Android currently does not allow you to save to OneTab any \"discarded\" tabs. A discarded tab is one that looks like an open tab in your list of tabs, but that Firefox does not consider active and is not stored in RAM. This is a bug in Firefox for Android that looks likely to be resolved by Mozilla within a few months.","weeklyDownloads":2563,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"OneTab Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10945418/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/269/269564.png?modified=1652891576","width":2400,"height":1800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/269/269564.jpg?modified=1652891576","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1592,"reviewCount":1174,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","updateDate":1696342139000},{"id":"Tab-Session-Manager@sienori","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/859/859942-32.png?modified=67bc175d","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/859/859942-64.png?modified=67bc175d","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/859/859942-128.png?modified=67bc175d"},"name":"Tab Session Manager","version":"7.0.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4298614/tab_session_manager-7.0.1.xpi","homepageURL":"https://tab-session-manager.sienori.com/","supportURL":"https://github.com/sienori/Tab-Session-Manager","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-session-manager/","description":"Save and restore the state of windows and tabs.

It's changed the way I work.\n– Wade Foster, CEO of Zapier\n\n______________________________________________\n\nFEATURES\n\nSpaces\nSpaces organize your work by project, so it’s easy to stay focused. Within a space, you can keep your current work open as tabs, or save everything for a project as resources.\n\nTab manager\nKeep your tabs under control with tab management that’s built for working in the cloud. Suspend tabs, rearrange tabs with drag and drop, and rest easy knowing that every tab is automatically saved.\n\nSecure backups\nYou never have to worry about losing work, because Workona auto-saves all of your tabs. In case of a browser crash or other emergency, you can easily restore your tabs to get you back on track.\n\nAccess apps\nUse your favorite cloud apps within Workona. Access your recent Google Docs, Asana Projects, Zoom Meetings and hundreds of other cloud resources, right from Workona. You can even create new cloud resources from the search bar.\n\nSuspend tabs\nDramatically reduce memory usage and keep your computer running faster. Our tab suspension helps you open spaces and switch between them almost instantly.\n\nBookmark tabs\nBookmark tabs in spaces by adding them as resources. You can also choose to save an entire window as a space.\n\nSearch tabs\nOur powerful search helps you find your tabs and docs faster. Search all open tabs—or previously open tabs—at a moment’s notice.\n\nSync tabs\nSync your tabs between computers to keep your work organized, no matter how many devices you use or where they are.\n\n\nPRIVACY & SECURITY\n\nWe believe that great software shouldn't come at a cost to privacy. We securely store your spaces in the cloud so you can keep your work backed up and accessible from anywhere you need it. Your data belongs to you and we store it for the sole purpose of providing value to you.\n\nWorkona is SOC 2 Type II compliant, has annual 3rd-party penetration tests performed, and uses enterprise-grade 256-bit AES encryption and Transport Layer Security (HTTPS) to prevent unauthorized access to your Workona data.\n\nIf you ever have questions about Workona’s security practices or your data, or if you're interested in us completing a security questionnaire for internal approval, reach out to us at security@workona.com.\n\nSUPPORT\n\nFeel free to contact support at support@workona.com and we'll reply as soon as possible.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nBy installing the extension, you agree to Workona’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.","weeklyDownloads":94,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Workona","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/15714402/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/286/286075.png?modified=1691635030","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/286/286075.jpg?modified=1691635030","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/251/251656.png?modified=1691635022","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/251/251656.jpg?modified=1691635022","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/286/286074.png?modified=1691635022","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/286/286074.jpg?modified=1691635022","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/251/251658.png?modified=1691635022","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/251/251658.jpg?modified=1691635022","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/251/251659.png?modified=1691635022","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/251/251659.jpg?modified=1691635022","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":3.621,"reviewCount":83,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/workona/reviews/","updateDate":1708727729000},{"id":"{3c764d86-a50a-4f5c-b773-cb84bea924e7}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/848/848241-32.png?modified=1586445259","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/848/848241-64.png?modified=1586445259","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/848/848241-128.png?modified=1586445259"},"name":"Tab Saver","version":"0.2.7","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4309708/vyrtsev_tab_saver-0.2.7.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/Reeywhaar/tabsaver","supportURL":"https://github.com/Reeywhaar/tabsaver","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vyrtsev-tab-saver/","description":"Allows you to manage and save tabs","fullDescription":"WebExtension to manage your tabs.
